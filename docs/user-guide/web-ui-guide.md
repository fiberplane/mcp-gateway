# Web UI Guide

The MCP Gateway Web UI provides an intuitive dashboard for managing MCP servers and browsing captured logs. Access it at `http://localhost:3333/ui` when the gateway is running.

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard shows:

- **Server List** - All registered MCP servers with health status
- **Quick Stats** - Total requests, errors, and last activity
- **Activity Log** - Real-time stream of captured MCP traffic
- **Search & Filter** - Find specific logs by criteria

## Managing Servers

### Adding a Server

1. Click the **"+ Add Server"** button in the top-right corner
2. Enter server details:
   - **Name**: Unique identifier (e.g., "my-server", "claude-tools")
   - **URL**: Server endpoint (e.g., "http://localhost:5000")
   - **Headers** (optional): Custom headers for requests
3. Click **"Add"**
4. Gateway performs health check and displays status

**Example:**
```
Name: claude-tools
URL: http://localhost:8000
Headers: Authorization: Bearer token123
```

### Monitoring Server Health

Each server card shows:

- **Status Indicator**: Green (up), red (down), gray (unknown)
- **Last Activity**: Timestamp of most recent request
- **Request Count**: Total requests since registration
- **Last Health Check**: When health was last verified

Click on a server to see detailed metrics:
- Average response time
- Error rate
- Request history
- Recent logs

### Removing a Server

1. Click on the server card or entry
2. Click **"Remove Server"**
3. Confirm deletion
4. **Note**: Logs are preserved; only the server registration is removed

## Viewing Logs

### Log List

The main log view shows a table with columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time** | Request timestamp (relative or absolute) |
| **Server** | Which server handled the request |
| **Method** | MCP method name (e.g., "initialize", "list_resources") |
| **Method Detail** | Human-readable preview of the request/response (e.g., tool arguments, response preview) |
| **Status** | HTTP status (200, 500, etc.) or error |
| **Duration** | Response time in milliseconds |
| **Tokens** | Estimated token count (input + output) for cost tracking - hover for breakdown |
| **Actions** | View details or export |

**Note on Token Estimates**: Token counts use a ~4 characters per token heuristic for approximate cost tracking. These are estimates (Â±10-20% variance) and should not be used for exact billing. For precise token counts, use your LLM provider's tokenizer.

### Viewing Log Details

Click on any log entry to expand and view:

- **Request JSON**: Full request payload
- **Response JSON**: Full response payload
- **Headers**: HTTP request/response headers
- **Session Info**: Client and server identification
- **Error Details**: Full error message and stack trace (if applicable)

### Filtering Logs

#### By Server

Click the **"Filter by Server"** dropdown to:
- Show all servers
- Select specific server
- Results update automatically

#### By Time Range

Use the **"Date Range"** picker:

**Quick Options:**
- Last hour
- Last 24 hours
- Last 7 days
- Custom range (select start and end dates)

**Example:**
```
Show logs from: 2024-10-22
To: 2024-10-23
For server: claude-tools
```

#### By Method

Type in the **"Method Filter"** to find specific MCP methods:

- `initialize` - Server initialization
- `list_resources` - List available resources
- `read_resource` - Read a resource
- `call_tool` - Execute a tool
- `list_tools` - List available tools

### Searching Logs

Use the **"Search"** bar to find logs by:

- **Server name**: "my-server"
- **Method name**: "call_tool"
- **Error messages**: "timeout"
- **Session ID**: "sess-abc123"

Search is **case-insensitive** and matches partial text.

### Exporting Logs

#### Export Single Log

1. Expand a log entry
2. Click **"Export"** or **"Copy JSON"**
3. Choose format:
   - **JSON**: Full structured data
   - **CSV**: Tabular format
   - **Text**: Human-readable format

#### Export Filtered Logs

1. Apply filters (server, time range, etc.)
2. Click **"Export All"** button
3. Choose format and download

**CSV Format Example:**
```csv
timestamp,server,method,status,duration_ms
2024-10-22T10:30:00Z,my-server,initialize,200,45
2024-10-22T10:30:01Z,my-server,list_resources,200,78
```

3. See which parameters are used in the **Method Detail** column
4. Analyze response patterns and token costs

### Identify Expensive Tool Calls

1. Click the **Tokens** column header to sort by token count
2. High token count calls appear at the top
3. Review these for optimization opportunities
4. Check if responses could be more concise

## Troubleshooting

### No logs appearing

**Causes:**
- Gateway is not receiving requests
- Wrong server name in filter
- Filter time range doesn't match actual requests

**Solutions:**
1. Check that gateway is running: `curl http://localhost:3333/api/servers`
2. Verify requests are actually going to gateway URL
3. Clear filters and try again
4. Check server health status

### Server shows "Health: unknown"

**Causes:**
- Server was just added (health check in progress)
- Server is not responding
- Network connectivity issue

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 5-10 seconds for initial health check
2. Click "Check Health" button manually
3. Verify server URL is correct and reachable
4. Check firewall and network settings

### Logs not updating in real-time

**Causes:**
- Real-time updates are paused
- Browser tab is backgrounded
- API is slow to respond

**Solutions:**
1. Click "Resume" button if paused
2. Bring browser tab to foreground
3. Manually refresh with browser refresh button
4. Check gateway performance

### Exporting logs fails

**Causes:**
- Large number of logs selected
- Browser memory limitation
- API timeout

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce filter scope (smaller time range)
2. Export in smaller batches
3. Try different export format
4. Use REST API for large exports

## Display Requirements

The Web UI is designed for desktop browsers:
- **Minimum Resolution**: 1280x720 (HD)
- **Recommended**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **Wide screens**: Better experience with more visible columns

**Note**: While the UI may be usable on larger tablets in landscape mode, mobile devices are not officially supported. Some responsive elements exist but full mobile optimization is not implemented.

## Accessibility

The Web UI follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

- Keyboard navigation supported
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast mode supported
- Focus indicators visible
- Semantic HTML structure

**Screen Reader Tips:**
- Headings: Use `H` key to navigate sections
- Tables: Use arrow keys to navigate cells
- Buttons: Use `Tab` to focus, `Enter` to activate
- Links: Use `Tab` to navigate, `Enter` to follow

## Browser Support

The Web UI aims to work with the latest versions of major desktop browsers:

- Chrome/Edge
- Firefox
- Safari

**Note**: The UI is designed for desktop browsers. While it may be usable on larger tablets in landscape mode, mobile devices are not officially supported. Cross-browser testing is not comprehensive, so your mileage may vary with older browser versions.

## Performance

The Web UI is optimized for:

- **Loading**: ~1-2 seconds initial load
- **Responsiveness**: <200ms interaction latency
- **Scalability**: Handles 10,000+ logs efficiently

**Performance Tips:**
- Close old browser tabs to free memory
- Clear browser cache periodically
- Use time range filters to reduce data
- Disable real-time updates if not needed

## Integration with Terminal UI

If using the Terminal UI alongside Web UI:

- Both share the same data (logs and servers)
- Changes in TUI appear in Web UI (with slight delay)
- Changes in Web UI appear in TUI instantly
- Both can filter and manage servers independently

## Preferences

Settings are stored in browser localStorage:

- **Theme**: Light or dark mode (if available)
- **Time Format**: 12/24 hour format
- **Sort Order**: Remember last sort preferences
- **Filters**: Remember last used filters

**To Reset:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application â LocalStorage
3. Find `mcp-gateway-ui`
4. Clear or edit values

## Help and Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check browser console for errors (F12 â Console)
2. Review [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) guide
3. Check [FAQ](./faq.md) for common questions
4. Open GitHub issue with:
   - Browser version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Screenshots or error messages
