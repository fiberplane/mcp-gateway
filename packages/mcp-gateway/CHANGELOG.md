# @fiberplane/mcp-gateway

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 424d3b6: Capture client and server identification metadata in all MCP traffic logs. The gateway now records client IP addresses, user agents, client info (name/version), and server info (name/version/title) for better observability and debugging. This metadata is captured from initialize handshakes and HTTP request headers, then attached to all subsequent request/response records in the session.
- 8a1640c: Adds support for proxying GET and DELETE routes, as well as support for client-to-server resposes (sampling, elicitation)
- 46c3f35: Add token estimation and method detail display

  - Token tracking with input/output breakdown
  - Method details showing function calls and response previews

- f347d0e: Add web UI MVP with SQLite storage, query API, and interactive log viewer

  This release introduces a comprehensive web-based user interface for viewing and analyzing MCP Gateway traffic, along with supporting backend infrastructure.

  **New Packages:**

  - `@fiberplane/mcp-gateway-api` - REST API for querying logs with filtering and pagination
  - `@fiberplane/mcp-gateway-web` - React-based web UI for viewing logs

  **Storage & Query Infrastructure:**

  - SQLite storage backend with composable architecture for MCP traffic capture
  - Database schema with Drizzle ORM for efficient log queries
  - Query API with filtering by server, session, method, and time range
  - Support for both SQLite and JSONL storage backends

  **Web UI Features:**

  - Interactive log table with expandable request/response details
  - Column sorting (timestamp, server, session, method, duration)
  - Direction indicators showing request (↓) vs response (↑) traffic
  - Checkbox selection and client-side JSONL export
  - Server and session filtering
  - Method badges with color coding
  - Copy-to-clipboard for request/response payloads

  **Server Enhancements:**

  - Dependency injection with flat options object pattern
  - Optional web UI serving via `publicDir` parameter
  - Integrated web UI at `/ui` endpoint in CLI
  - `--no-tui` flag for running without terminal UI

  **CLI Improvements:**

  - Serve web UI at `http://localhost:3333/ui` by default
  - Mount query API at `/api` endpoint
  - Fixed session and server filtering parameter names
  - Beautiful landing page at root (/) with web design system styling
  - Landing page includes version badge, welcome message, "Open Web UI" button, and API endpoints reference

  **Code Quality:**

  - Removed JSONL storage backend and references for SQLite-only architecture
  - Fixed Biome linter warnings for optional chaining and unused parameters
  - Cleaned up unused imports and deprecated functions

  **Developer Experience:**

  - Comprehensive documentation for web UI architecture and implementation
  - API specification and design tokens documented
  - Planning documents for real-time updates and future enhancements

### Patch Changes

- af2b7dc: Polish log table UI and improve accessibility with better focus indicators, solid color system, and improved keyboard navigation support for row expansion.
- d92b315: Refactored web UI: extracted 10 reusable components and removed 6 unused components for improved maintainability

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- c8c1709: Small patch bump to ensure the correct version is reflected.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- dc6585c: Patch bump to ensure all fixes are included.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- daf5a26: Binary distribution release

  This release introduces pre-compiled binaries for the MCP Gateway CLI, making installation and execution significantly faster and more reliable.

  **Binary Distribution:**

  - Pre-compiled standalone binaries for macOS ARM64 and Linux x64
  - 61MB executables with all dependencies bundled (no separate installation needed)
  - Platform-specific packages with automatic detection during installation
  - Binary-only distribution model: internal library packages are private and not published

  **Installation Improvements:**

  - Full npx/bunx compatibility using require.resolve() pattern (matching esbuild/biome)
  - Runtime chmod to ensure binary execute permissions
  - Improved error handling with clear diagnostics for missing binaries
  - JavaScript wrapper for cross-platform compatibility

  **Package Structure:**

  - Monorepo split into types, core, server, and CLI packages for better separation of concerns
  - Binary-only distribution model: types, core, and server packages are now private and not published to npm
  - Only wrapper and platform-specific binaries are published to npm
  - Platform binary packages as optional dependencies

### Patch Changes

- 0c76ba1: Fix CI publishing: ignore compiled binaries.

## 0.4.0-next.6

### Patch Changes

- Remove bin field from platform packages to fix npx execution

  Platform packages should not have bin fields as this causes npx to try executing the binary directly instead of going through the wrapper script. Only the CLI wrapper package should declare the bin entry point.

## 0.4.0-next.5

### Patch Changes

- Make binary executable at runtime in wrapper

  npm doesn't preserve execute permissions on binary files. The wrapper now runs chmod on the binary before executing it to ensure it has execute permissions.

## 0.4.0-next.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix binary execute permissions in published packages

  Add bin field to platform packages so npm preserves execute permissions on binary files. Also improve error handling to show EACCES errors when binary is not executable.

## 0.4.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- Add debug output to wrapper when binary not found

  Show searched paths and existence checks to help diagnose installation issues.

## 0.4.0-next.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix optionalDependencies using workspace: protocol in published package

  Changesets doesn't replace workspace:\* in optionalDependencies, causing npm/bunx to fail. Now using explicit version numbers that will be kept in sync during releases.

## 0.4.0-next.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix bunx/npx execution by replacing postinstall with JavaScript wrapper

  The previous postinstall approach didn't work with bunx/npx because they don't run install scripts before executing binaries. Now using a CommonJS wrapper (bin/mcp-gateway.cjs) that dynamically finds and executes the platform-specific binary, matching the pattern used by esbuild and other binary packages.

## 0.4.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- Binary Distribution Preview

  This preview release introduces binary distribution for the MCP Gateway CLI:

  - Pre-compiled binaries for macOS (ARM64/x64), Linux x64, and Windows x64
  - Platform-specific packages with automatic detection during installation
  - 61MB standalone executables with all dependencies bundled
  - Improved installation experience with npm/npx
