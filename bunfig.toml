# Root Bun configuration
#
# NOTE: Running 'bun test' from root will fail immediately with a helpful message.
# Use 'bun run test' instead to run each workspace's tests with proper config.

[test]
# Run tests only from the test/ directory (sentinel test)
# This prevents discovering tests in packages/
root = "test"
